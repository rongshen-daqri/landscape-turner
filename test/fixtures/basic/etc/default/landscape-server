# NOTE: if a schema upgrade is necessary, but this is set to
# "no", the Landscape service WON'T (RE)START until the schema is
# upgraded. In that case, the schema will need to be upgraded
# manually by calling the setup-landscape-server script as root
# after the package was upgraded.
#
# Only if this is set to "yes" will landscape-server upgrade the database schema.
# Note that if you install the landscape-server-quickstart package and have this
# setting commented, or set to no value, that package will set it to "yes".
# Otherwise it will be left alone.
